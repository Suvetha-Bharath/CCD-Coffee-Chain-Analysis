☕ CCD Financial Analysis – Excel Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the financial performance of Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) to identify reasons for its losses 📉. Using an Excel Dashboard 📊, the dataset was explored to uncover trends, product performance, and cost inefficiencies affecting profitability.

❓ Problem Statement

CCD, one of India’s largest coffee chains, has been losing money 💸. The goal of this project is to analyze sales, profits, and costs across different regions and products to pinpoint the key factors contributing to these losses.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes product name, state, market, market size, product type, product line, sales, profit, and cost data from 2012 & 2013 for 3 months📆.

Key Fields:

###🛍️ Product Name
###💰 Sales & Profit Figures
###📊 Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
###🎯 Target vs. Actual Performance
###🌍 Regional Data

📈 Key Insights
🔹 Revenue Trends: 2013 📆 had higher revenue (+6.67%) than 2012, with December being the best-performing 🏆 month and November being the worst ❌.

🔹 Low-Profit Products: Green Tea (-89.35%) 🍵, Caffe Mocha (4.07%) ☕, and Mint (8.66%) 🌿 had low or negative profit margins.

🔹 Sales vs. Profit Discrepancy: Some high-sales stores (e.g., Store 518 - $700 in sales but $232 loss) 📊 struggled due to costing inefficiencies.

🔹 Target vs. Actual Performance: 3 products ❌ missed their sales targets (Decaf Irish Cream: -669, Colombian: -599, Caffe Mocha: -164).

🔹 COGS Issues: Some products had COGS > Sales, leading to losses (Herbal Tea – Mint: +1.4%, Caffe Mocha: +2%, Green Tea: +4.7%).

✅ Recommendations
✔️ Optimize Pricing & Cost Control 💲: Adjust prices & sourcing for low-profit products like Green Tea & Caffe Mocha.
✔️ Improve Inventory & Supplier Management 📦: Reduce excess stock and renegotiate supplier contracts to lower COGS.
✔️ Focus on High-Sales, Low-Profit Stores 🏪: Stores like Store 518 need better cost management to maximize profits.
✔️ Enhance Regional Strategies 🌍: Special offers, localized pricing, and better promotions can boost sales in West & East regions for loss making products.
